# Process Log

- [x] Read `AGENT.md` and captured requirements for Expo background audio setup.
- [x] Scaffolded `expo-bgm-player` TypeScript project with Expo 54 dependencies and required dev tooling.
- [x] Configured `app.json` for iOS background audio (`UIBackgroundModes`) and Android foreground service/permissions.
- [x] Added TrackPlayer service (`service.ts`) with background event handlers and iOS audio session category.
- [x] Updated `index.ts` to register the TrackPlayer service and `App.tsx` with minimal playback UI/logic.
- [x] Installed native assets (`android/`, `ios/`) via `npx expo prebuild`.
- [ ] `npx expo run:ios` (blocked: CocoaPods CLI not linked; install manually with `brew link cocoapods` and rerun).
- [ ] `npx expo run:android` (not attempted; requires Android env).

Notes:
- `npx expo prebuild` succeeded after removing the TrackPlayer config plugin entry (library does not ship one). iOS audio session is forced via `TrackPlayer.updateOptions`.
- Run `npx expo start --dev-client` after building iOS/Android dev clients to share with teammates.
